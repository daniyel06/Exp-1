# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To draw the UML diagram for ATM and Banking System.

# SRS (Procedure):

## Step 1: Problem Identification

The main problem is the need for a fast, secure, and automated system that allows customers to perform banking transactions (like withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfer) without depending on bank staff.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Identify user needs (customer, admin, staff).      
Define functional requirements: login, balance check, withdrawal, deposit, transfer, PIN change.      
Define non-functional requirements: speed, security, reliability, and usability.      

## Step 3: System Design

Draw UML diagrams to represent the system:      
Use Case Diagram      
Class Diagram      
Activity Diagram      
Sequence Diagram      
Communication Diagram      
Package Diagram      
Design the database with tables for Customer, Account, and Transaction.
